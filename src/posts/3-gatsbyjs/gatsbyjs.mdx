As I mentioned in my last post, I recently discovered the JAMstack and static site generators after some research following an internship interview with a local ad agency. It was through several articles and developer podcast playthroughs that I properly informed myself on GatsbyJS. What I learned about it quickly inspired me to try it out by spending my short Christmas vacation rebuilding my portfolio website.

At it's most simple definition, GatsbyJS is a framework for building fast websites and apps out-of-the-box. It's best known to be a static site generator; however, it’s very important to note that Gatsby can render dynamic content.   It consists of the usage of React, Webpack, and GraphQL. Gatsby can pull data from several different places such as markdown, csv, json project files or external sources like an API, databases, WordPress, or Drupal. The whole approach mimics the typical BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle) restaurant culture that’s popular in the United States. In this case, it’s BYOD(Bring Your Own Data).
This data gets piped through GraphQL queries via React. GraphQL is an API manipulation language for easily requesting data from a variety of different sources. It’s a faster approach to calling functions over a network versus the traditional REST approach. That’s a whole different subject within itself and one I hope to cover soon. 

Aside from being able to use the fast API query language developed by Facebook , GatsbyJS also makes image optimization easy. Optimizing images and using lazy-loading are techniques which significantly improve the performance and UX of a website. Gatsby also configures your project build to automatically perform as best as it can. It sets up webpack to do code splitting which optimizes how CSS and Javascript are delivered. Gatsby also configures Babel, a Javascript compiler, to make your dynamic content more compatible with older browsers.  All these features, or should I say industry best practices, come in the form of a starter kit that’s already preconfigured to score all A’s in Lighthouse performance, SEO, and accessibility audit tests. 

At the core of this entire mesh of features is React. React is a modern Javascript framework which produces responsive single page applications. To date, my only modern Javascript framework experience was with Angular. They are completely different in the way they are built. Angular is very opinionated while React follows a more minimalistic ecosystem approach. Both frameworks support components and data binding.

I created my past portfolio page with it alongside a few small tutorial projects in Angular. React and GraphQL were foreign tools to me prior to picking up Gatsby. It turns out that not only is the Gatsby documentation easy to follow but I also found myself learning React along with several other new technologies. I’ve been enjoying being able to dive in partially into all these technologies with Gatsby’s moderate learning curve. I don’t need to entirely know React or how to set up a GraphQL server to work with Gatsby. Gatsby scales with your expertise and scope. Many features are all set up out of the box.

I've been learning Gatsby via John Smilga's "Gatsby Tutorial and Projects Course" on Udemy. It's packed with 38.5 hours of video and 5 total projects. It's been quite enjoyable picking up Gatsby and small parts of React during this course. I'm hoping to attack React head-on via some dedicated coureses relatively soon. I'll cover more on Gatsby soon as I start to incorporate more dynamic features into my projects. Until next time, Ciao!
