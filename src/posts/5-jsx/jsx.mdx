My second week with React has really reinforced my understanding of how JSX works. As I mentioned in my previous post, I understood JSX as a shorthand for calling `React.createElement()`. This week, I've decided to try and break down how JSX works. It may seem impractical to write code that eventually gets compiled down to vanilla Javascript. I've come to appreciate a bit of JSX after really seeing what it actually does for me.

This component renders a `H1` and `P` HTML tags.

# JSX

```javascript
class GiveTaco extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1 className="large">Have a Taco! ðŸŒ®</h1>
  }
}
```

These two tags are within the `render()` function in the GiveTaco component. This component appears to be rendering HTML, but it is not! The code above actually gets translated to vanilla Javascript at runtime to produce this code right below.

# Javascript

```javascript
class GiveTaco extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement("h1", { className: "large" }, "Have a Taco ðŸŒ®")
  }
}
```

You may have noticed that `className` replaces the standard CSS `class` within the `H1` tag. The `class` attribute can't be used since it is a reserved word in JSX. Instead, `class` is used to mimic the `class` keyword found in other object oriented languages. This isn't just a a concept unique to JSX, but one that has been incorporated into the language since the release of ES6. The `for` attribute on a label is also a reserved word in JSX.

You may have also noticed the unique camelCase format in `className`. JSX is very similar to Javascript in using the same camelCase naming convention within its ecosystem. At the end of the it all, React ends up writing this HTML code to the DOM.

`<h1 class='large'>Hello World</h1>`

Now that's what I call HTML! As you would in writing traditional HTML code, you can nest several lines of JSX within one element. All JSX expressions must have a parent element. It's typically a best practice to wrap everything in one root element per component.

```html
(
<div>
  <h1>Have a taco ðŸŒ®</h1>
  <p>You earned it!</p>
</div>
)
```

JSX nests HTML elements very nicely when all put together. Thus far, it has appeared to save me several lines of code by writing things out in JSX. I could of surely written things out in vanilla Javascript, but things would of gotten way more messy as I added more elements into the mix.

I've also discovered that your typical self-closing HTML tags, such as `<IMG>` & `<BR>`, must contain a forward slash before closing the tag out.

**_This works in JSX_**

```javascript
<img src="taco.png" alt="carnitas taco" />
```

**_This does not work in JSX_**

```javascript
<img src="taco.png" alt="carnitas taco" >
```

That's the majority of the JSX I've been able to wrap my head around in the past week. I'm currently en-route on the train heading to the Chicago Javascript Meetup for February at the YUM! Brands office in downtown Chicago. This month will feature two speakers covering the "12 Factor App Principles" & UI Design Systems for React. I can't wait to absorb more things this evening. Until next time!
