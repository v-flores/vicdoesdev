sinopsis: "Headless CMS - a modern web development paradym shift"
---

The modern web development landscape is changing in a very positive way. While I've casually heard the mention of many of the technologies I'm discussing , I didn't really understand how they work until quite recently. I got a grasp of the real world use of decoupled web architecture while interviewing for a Wordpress Developer Internship. The job description for the internship at a Chicago based ad agency centered the usage of Wordpress and PHP.

My initial assumption was that this internship would revolve around using the LAMP, XAMPP, or MAMP stack. I was fortunate enough to make it to a second round interview, a first for me to date as a career changer, where I was able to talk more in-depth with the systems architect regarding the position. I asked questions about the current tech stack being used and discovered that the agency was in the process of "decoupling their client Wordpress websites". I also asked where the usage of Angular, React, and Vue came into play for this position seeing as how the main focus of the job description appeared to center around Wordpress. The familiarity of using one of these JavaScript frameworks was also required for this role.

Through several follow-up questions, I quickly learned that either of these Javascript frameworks were capable of consuming the API from a Wordpress website. The single page architecture of these frameworks ensure websites donâ€™t make numerous HTTP requests to load each web page, which significantly improves user experience. I always interpreted traditional content management systems such as Wordpress as heavily opinionated. You typically have to abide by the PHP and Wordpress templating system rules and methodologies as developer. The Headless approach discussed came off to me as a modern way to have more control over the S (system) in CMS as a developer.

Despite the great and insightful interview conversation I had with this systems architect, I was not chosen for this position. Regardless, this interview call sparked many mental lightbulbs. I ended up spending much of my Christmas break studying headless architecture approaches in web development.


The most commonly discussed positives to headless web development architecture that I discovered include
- greater performance
- leaving opinionated CMS coding ecosystems
- the ability to serve content on multiple platforms including IoT devices and mobile apps
- increased scalability and future proofing of website implementation

While many developers might not be the biggest fans of Wordpress, there's no doubt most content managers and creators still love it. Headless CMS gives these professionals the ability to keep working in a platform they feel most comfortable with while allowing developers the opportunity to be free of the conventions and limitations in place by these platforms. Developers can pipe the content of the CMS in more directions then before via a web-service API. The end-user experience gets delivered by a modern JavaScript framework. I considered possibly decoupling a previous Wordpress side project with Angular which I'm most familiar with. I instead ended up diving into the usage of a static site generator and the implementation of the Jamstack.

The final product of that Christmas break ended up becoming my new portfolio website and blog.  I'll breakdown my first usage of a static site generator as well as my JAMstack approach in my next post.

Until next time, keep learning!
